Socket-based modular chatbot that can run on Raspberry Pi 4 with transcription, thought, and speech

You need to install Ollama separately (from ollama repo).
You need to install docker separately.

Then `docker compose up -d` to run.

You may need to add some welcome messages (run src/own_tongue.py to generate arbitrary speech) to wavs or src/wavs. Let me know if you're interested in this project and I'll help you set it up.
